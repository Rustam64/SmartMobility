## Overview

This ROS package, `action_tutorials_interfaces`, provides custom action message interfaces for the "Mapping and Exploration" action. It includes the necessary files and configurations to define the structure of the action, which can be used in your ROS nodes for various robotic mapping and exploration tasks.

## Package Contents

- `CMakeLists.txt`: The CMake configuration file for building the package.
- `package.xml`: The package manifest file describing package dependencies and metadata.
- `action/MappingAndExploration.action`: The custom action definition file for "Mapping and Exploration" action.

## Action Definition

The "Mapping and Exploration" action is defined as follows:

### Goal
- `nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid map`: The goal for the action, typically representing a map for exploration.

### Result
- `nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid map`: The result of the action, which may also represent a map.

### Feedback
- `geometry_msgs/Pose current_pose`: Feedback information, often indicating the current position.
- `nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid current_map`: Feedback information, potentially representing the current map.

## Building and Usage

To build and use this package, follow these steps:

1. Clone the package into your ROS workspace.
2. Build your ROS workspace using `colcon` or the appropriate ROS build tool.

   ```bash
   colcon build
   ```
1. Run the server side CPP code to get the output.

2. You can now use the custom "Mapping and Exploration" action in your ROS nodes and services by including the generated action interface files in your code. For example, in C++:

   ```cpp
   #include "action_tutorials_interfaces/action/mapping_and_exploration.hpp"
   ```

   Use the generated action type to create action clients and servers to perform mapping and exploration tasks.
